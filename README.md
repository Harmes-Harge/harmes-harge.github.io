russian slang is a devastating perversion of the mind.  
whatever art you show to russians, if that is not something trivial, they tell "не прикольно"  
[word "prikol" cannot be translated to english, originally meant "a skewer" ["pri-kol", "a fastener, pin"] ("a joke", loaned from english "to skewer"), but its meaning was replaced with a positive for a speaker aspect of a satisfaction and a pleasure of "skewering" and had become a standard term for glosses "amicable", "nice", "pretty", "handsome", "interesting"]
